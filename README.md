# Engine Checker ðŸŽ›

Engine Checker will check engines you have defined in a file or `package.json`
section that satisfies your global or locally installed program version.

**Why?**

Because NPM does this only when someone else installs you program but sometimes
you don't want your friends to get errors with having the wrong node version and
it is somehow usefull for some people.

## How to use

### Programmatically

```ts
import EngineChecker from 'engine-checker'

const checker = new EngineChecker({
  engines: {
    node: '>=10.3.0',
  },
})
```

> Psst! Have a look at our [tests](./test) to see more examples.
